# *IN SITU* HI-C STEP 02: LYSIS & RESTRICTION DIGEST, MARKING OF DNA ENDS, PROXIMITY LIGATION, & CROSSLINK REVERSAL
---
## LAB INSTRUCTIONS 

### LYSIS AND RESTRICTION DIGEST

1) Combine 250μl of ice-cold Hi-C lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 10mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA630) with
50μl of protease inhibitors (Sigma, P8340). Add to one crosslinked pellet of cells.
2) Incubate cell suspension on ice for >15 minutes. Centrifuge at 2500xG for 5 minutes. Discard the
supernatant.
3) Wash pelleted nuclei once with 500μl of ice-cold Hi-C lysis buffer.
4) Gently resuspend pellet in 50μl of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and incubate at 62°C for 5-10 minutes.
5) After heating is over, add 145μl of water and 25μl of 10% Triton X-100 (Sigma, 93443) to quench the SDS.
Mix well, avoiding excessive foaming. Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
6) Add 25μl of 10X NEBuffer2 and 100U of MboI restriction enzyme (NEB, R0147) and digest chromatin overnight or for at least 2 hours at 37°C with rotation.

### MARKING OF DNA ENDS, PROXIMITY LIGATION, AND CROSSLINK REVERSAL 

7) Incubate at 62°C for 20 minutes to inactivate MboI, then cool to room temperature.
14) To fill in the restriction fragment overhangs and mark the DNA ends with biotin, add 50μl of fill-in master mix:
    * 37.5μl of 0.4mM biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, 19524-016)
    * 1.5μl of 10mM dCTP
    * 1.5μl of 10mM dGTP
    * 1.5μl of 10mM dTTP
    * 8μl of 5U/μl DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (NEB, M0210)
15) Mix by pipetting and incubate at 37°C for 45 minutes-1.5 hours with rotation.
16) Add 900μl of ligation master mix:
    * 663μl of water
    * 120μl of 10X NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB, B0202)
    * 100μl of 10% Triton X-100
    * 12μl of 10mg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (100X BSA)
    * 5μl of 400 U/ μl T4 DNA Ligase (NEB, M0202)
17) Mix by inverting and incubate at room temperature for 4 hours with slow rotation.
18) Degrade protein by adding 50μl of 20mg/ml proteinase K (NEB, P8102) and 120μl of 10% SDS and incubateat 55°C for 30 minutes. 
    -  _Note:  nuclei can be pelleted after ligation and then resuspended, both to removerandom ligation products that may have occurred in solution and to reduce the overall volume for ease of handling._
19) Add 130μl of 5M sodium chloride and incubate at 68°C overnight or for at least 1.5 hours.
