# *IN SITU* HI-C STEP 02: LYSIS & RESTRICTION DIGEST
---
## LAB INSTRUCTIONS 

### LYSIS AND RESTRICTION DIGEST

1) Combine 250μl of ice-cold Hi-C lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 10mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA630) with
50μl of protease inhibitors (Sigma, P8340). Add to one crosslinked pellet of cells.
2) Incubate cell suspension on ice for >15 minutes. Centrifuge at 2500xG for 5 minutes. Discard the
supernatant.
3) Wash pelleted nuclei once with 500μl of ice-cold Hi-C lysis buffer.
4) Gently resuspend pellet in 50μl of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and incubate at 62°C for 5-10 minutes.
5) After heating is over, add 145μl of water and 25μl of 10% Triton X-100 (Sigma, 93443) to quench the SDS.
Mix well, avoiding excessive foaming. Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
6) Add 25μl of 10X NEBuffer2 and 100U of MboI restriction enzyme (NEB, R0147) and digest chromatin overnight or for at least 2 hours at 37°C with rotation.
