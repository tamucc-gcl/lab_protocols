# _IN SITU_ HI-C STEP 01: CROSSLINK & STORE IN FIELD

This protocol is the first step in preparing your samples for _in situ_ Hi-C. 

_It is important to use blood, cells, or tissue with intact nuclei and chromatids._

## LAB EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES

*	Sample box to hold tubes
*	Razors & Forceps
*	Fine-tip sharpie
*	Tube rocker
*	1mL Pipette
*	Pipette Tips (4 boxes)
*	Graduated Cylinder
*	Gloves
*	Sample labels laser printed on waterproof paper

## FIELD EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES

* 1% Fresh Formaldehyde in Filtered Seawater
  * 1 mL per sample * 1.05
* Either Glycine or 5M Tris-HCL ph8.0
  * Glycine: XXXuL per sample * 1.05
  * Tris: 176.5 uL per sample * 1.05
* PBS
  * 1 mL per sample * 1.05
* DNA Preservative
  * Original protocol calls for 95% EtOH
  * Untested alternatives: RNA-Later, DMSO Salt Saturated & Buffered Solution
  * 1-2 mL per sample 
 
* Centrifuge capable of 300G (if processing cells/blood/hemolymph as opposed to tissue)
* p-1000 pippetor
* 1000 uL pippet tips
  * at least 4 per sample + 3 * number of times protocol is conducted
  * ex: 2 samples on day 1 and 5 samples on day 2 = 4 tips * (5+2 samples) + 3 tips * 2 days = at least 34 tips
* Snap cap 1.5 to 2 mL reaction tubes
  * at least 1 per sample + a few to balance centrifuge if working with blood/hemolymph/cells
* Screw cap 1-2 mL storage tubes w/ o-ring
  * 1 per sample
  * pre-filled with 95 - 100% EtOH
* Tube block
*	Tube box for storage
*	Cutting board
* Razors & Forceps
* 3mL syringes & 18 gauge needles (optional, for collection of blood/hemolymph)
* Sanitizing wipes (70%+ EtOH)
*	Fine-tip sharpie
*	Gloves
*	Lighter

## LAB INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix chemicals required & store each in a leak and break proof container
2. Add labels and DNA preservative to screw cap tubes
   * place in storage/transport box
   * tape a tube map to the box
3.

## FIELD INSTRUCTIONS

1) Grow two to five million mammalian cells under recommended culture conditions to about 80% confluence.
Pellet suspension cells or detached adherent cells by centrifugation at 300xG for 5 minutes.
•	Use Filtered Seawater to suspend cells & pellet – remove supernatant
2) Resuspend cells in fresh medium at a concentration of 1x106 cells per 1 ml media. In a fume hood, add
freshly made formaldehyde solution to a final concentration of 1%, v/v. Incubate at room temperature for
10 minutes with mixing.
•	Add 1mL of buffered formaldehyde & filtered seawater to each sample
3) Add 5M Tris solution to a final concentration of 750mM to quench the reaction. Incubate at room
temperature for 5 minutes on rocker. 
•	Change from Glycine to Tris based on this protocol and links therein 
o	https://star-protocols.cell.com/protocols/71 
•	Add 150uL of Tris solution to buffered formaldehyde & sample solution
4) Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 300xG at 4°C. Discard supernatant into an appropriate collection container.
5) Resuspend cells in 1ml of cold 1X PBS and spin for 5 minutes at 300xG at 4°C. Discard supernatant and
flash-freeze cell pellets in liquid nitrogen or dry ice/ ethanol.
6) Either proceed to the rest of the protocol or store cell pellets at -80°C
