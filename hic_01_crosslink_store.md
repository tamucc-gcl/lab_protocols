# _IN SITU_ HI-C STEP 01: CROSSLINK & STORE IN FIELD

This protocol is the first step in preparing your samples for _in situ_ Hi-C. 

_It is important to use blood, cells, or tissue with intact nuclei and chromatids._

## LAB EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES

*	Sample box to hold tubes
*	Razors & Forceps
*	Fine-tip sharpie
*	Tube rocker
*	1mL Pipette
*	Pipette Tips (4 boxes)
*	Graduated Cylinder
*	Gloves
*	Sample labels laser printed on waterproof paper

## FIELD EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES

* 1% Fresh Formaldehyde in Filtered Seawater
  * 1 mL per sample * 1.05
* Either Glycine or 5M Tris-HCL ph8.0
  * Glycine: XXXuL per sample * 1.05
  * Tris: 176.5 uL per sample * 1.05
* PBS
  * 1 mL per sample * 1.05
* DNA Preservative
  * Original protocol calls for 95% EtOH
  * Untested alternatives: RNA-Later, DMSO Salt Saturated & Buffered Solution
  * 1-2 mL per sample 
 
* Centrifuge capable of 300G (if processing cells/blood/hemolymph as opposed to tissue)
* p-1000 pippetor
* 1000 uL pippet tips
  * at least 4 per sample + 3 * number of times protocol is conducted
  * ex: 2 samples on day 1 and 5 samples on day 2 = 4 tips * (5+2 samples) + 3 tips * 2 days = at least 34 tips
* Snap cap 1.5 to 2 mL reaction tubes
  * at least 1 per sample + a few to balance centrifuge if working with blood/hemolymph/cells
* Screw cap 1-2 mL storage tubes w/ o-ring
  * 1 per sample
  * pre-filled with 95 - 100% EtOH
* Tube block
*	Tube box for storage
*	Cutting board
* Razors & Forceps
* 3mL syringes & 18 gauge needles (optional, for collection of blood/hemolymph)
* Sanitizing wipes (70%+ EtOH)
*	Fine-tip sharpie
*	Gloves
*	Lighter

## LAB INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix chemicals required & store each in a leak and break proof container
2. Add labels and DNA preservative to screw cap tubes
   * place in storage/transport box
   * tape a tube map to the box
3.

## FIELD INSTRUCTIONS FOR CELLS

1. Grow two to five million mammalian cells under recommended culture conditions to about 80% confluence.
2. Pellet suspension cells or detached adherent cells by centrifugation at 300xG for 5 minutes.
3. Crosslink DNA by adding 1 mL formaldehyde solution (final concentration of 1%, v/v) to pellet & resuspend cells by inverting and flicking tubes. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes while inverting tubes.
4. Add reagent to quench the crosslinking reaction and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes with gentle mixing (slowly rock tubes)
   * Either add XXX uL Glycine (final concentration of XXXmM)
   * or add 176.5 uL, 5M Tris solution (final concentration of 750mM) to quench the reaction. 
     *	Change from Glycine to Tris based on this protocol and links therein https://star-protocols.cell.com/protocols/71 
•	Add 150uL of Tris solution to buffered formaldehyde & sample solution
4) Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 300xG at 4°C. Discard supernatant into an appropriate collection container.
5) Resuspend cells in 1ml of cold 1X PBS and spin for 5 minutes at 300xG at 4°C. Discard supernatant and
flash-freeze cell pellets in liquid nitrogen or dry ice/ ethanol.
6) Either proceed to the rest of the protocol or store cell pellets at -80°C
