### BIOTIN PULL-DOWN & SEQUENCING PREP
_Note: Perform all the following steps in low-bind tubes._


1) Prepare for biotin pull-down by washing 150μl of 10mg/ml Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Life technologies, 65602) with 400μl of 1X Tween Washing Buffer (1X TWB: 5mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 0.5mM EDTA; 1M NaCl; 0.05% Tween 20). 
2) Separate on a magnet and discard the solution.
3) Resuspend the beads in 300μl of 2X Binding Buffer (2X BB: 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 1mM EDTA; 2M NaCl) and add to the reaction. 
4) Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes with rotation to bind biotinylated DNA
to the streptavidin beads.
5) Separate on a magnet and discard the solution.
6) Wash the beads by adding 600μl of 1X TWB and transferring the mixture to a new tube. 
7) Heat the tubes on a Thermomixer at 55°C for 2 min with mixing. Reclaim the beads using a magnet. Discard supernatant.
8) Repeat wash.
9) Resuspend beads in 100ul 1X NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB, B0202) and transfer to a new tube. Reclaim beads and discard the buffer.
10) To repair ends of sheared DNA and remove biotin from unligated ends, resuspend beads in 100μl of master mix:
    - 88μl of 1X NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer with 10mM ATP S33
    - 2μl of 25mM dNTP mix
    - 5μl of 10U/μl NEB T4 PNK (NEB, M0201)
    - 4μl of 3U/μl NEB T4 DNA polymerase I (NEB, M0203)
    - 1μl of 5U/μl NEB DNA polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (NEB, M0210)
11) Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Separate on a magnet and discard the solution.
12) Wash the beads by adding 600μl of 1X TWB and transferring the mixture to a new tube.
13) Heat the tubes on a Thermomixer at 55°C for 2 min with mixing. Reclaim the beads using a magnet. Discard supernatant.
14) Repeat wash.
15) Resuspend beads in 100μl 1X NEBuffer 2 and transfer to a new tube. Reclaim beads and discard the buffer.
16) Resuspend beads in 100μl of dATP attachment master mix:
    - 90μl of 1X NEBuffer 2
    - 5μl of 10mM dATP
    - 5μl of 5U/μl NEB Klenow exo minus (NEB, M0212)
17) Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes. Separate on a magnet and discard the solution.
18) Wash the beads by adding 600μl of 1X TWB and transferring the mixture to a new tube. Heat the tubes on a Thermomixer at 55°C for 2 min with mixing. Reclaim the beads using a magnet. Discard supernatant.
19) Repeat wash.
20) Resuspend beads in 100μl 1X Quick ligation reaction buffer (NEB, B6058) and transfer to a new tube. Reclaim beads and discard the buffer.
21) Resuspend in 50μl of 1X NEB Quick ligation reaction buffer.
22) Add 2μl of NEB DNA Quick ligase (NEB, M2200). Add 3μl of an Illumina indexed adapter. Record the sample-index combination. Mix thoroughly.
23) Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Separate on a magnet and discard the solution.
24) Wash the beads by adding 600μl of 1X TWB and transferring the mixture to a new tube. Heat the tubes on a Thermomixer at 55°C for 2 min with mixing. Reclaim the beads using a magnet. Remove supernatant.
25) Repeat wash.
26) Resuspend beads in 100μl 1X Tris buffer and transfer to a new tube. Reclaim beads and discard the buffer.
27) Resuspend in 50μl of 1X Tris buffer.
