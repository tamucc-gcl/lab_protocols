### FINAL AMPLIFICATION & PURIFICATION
1) Amplify the Hi-C library directly off of the T1 beads with 4-12 cycles of PCR, using Illumina primers and protocol (Illumina, 2007). 
_Note: recent lots of some streptavidin beads may interfere with PCR; to avoid this, one can remove the DNA from the streptavidin beads by heating at 98C for 10 minutes after step 27 of 'In situ HI-C step 04: biotin pull-down & sequencing prep' and then removing the beads with a magnet._
2) After amplification is complete, bring the total library volume to 250μl.
3) Separate on a magnet. Transfer the solution to a fresh tube and discard the beads.
4) Warm a bottle of AMPure XP beads to room temperature. Gently shake to resuspend the magnetic beads.
5) Add 175μl of beads to the PCR reaction (0.7X volumes). Mix by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
6) Separate on a magnet and remove the clear solution.
7) Keeping the beads on the magnet, wash once with 700μl of 70% ethanol without mixing.
8) Remove ethanol completely. To remove traces of short products, resuspend in 100μl of 1X Tris buffer and add another 70μl of AMPure XP beads. 
9) Mix by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
10) Separate on a magnet and remove the clear solution.
11) Keeping the beads on the magnet, wash twice with 700μl of 70% ethanol without mixing.
12) Leave the beads on the magnet for 5 minutes to allow the remaining ethanol to evaporate.
13) Add 25-50μl of 1X Tris buffer to elute DNA. Mix by pipetting, incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes, separate on a magnet, and transfer the solution to a fresh labeled tube. 
14) The result is a final in situ Hi-C library ready to be quantified and sequenced using an Illumina sequencing platform.
