### MARKING OF DNA ENDS, PROXIMITY LIGATION, AND CROSSLINK REVERSAL 
1) Incubate at 62°C for 20 minutes to inactivate MboI, then cool to room temperature.
2) To fill in the restriction fragment overhangs and mark the DNA ends with biotin, add 50μl of fill-in master mix:
    * 37.5μl of 0.4mM biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, 19524-016)
    * 1.5μl of 10mM dCTP
    * 1.5μl of 10mM dGTP
    * 1.5μl of 10mM dTTP
    * 8μl of 5U/μl DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (NEB, M0210)
3) Mix by pipetting and incubate at 37°C for 45 minutes-1.5 hours with rotation.
4) Add 900μl of ligation master mix:
    * 663μl of water
    * 120μl of 10X NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB, B0202)
    * 100μl of 10% Triton X-100
    * 12μl of 10mg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (100X BSA)
    * 5μl of 400 U/ μl T4 DNA Ligase (NEB, M0202)
5) Mix by inverting and incubate at room temperature for 4 hours with slow rotation.
6) Degrade protein by adding 50μl of 20mg/ml proteinase K (NEB, P8102) and 120μl of 10% SDS and incubateat 55°C for 30 minutes. 
    -  _Note:  nuclei can be pelleted after ligation and then resuspended, both to removerandom ligation products that may have occurred in solution and to reduce the overall volume for ease of handling._
7) Add 130μl of 5M sodium chloride and incubate at 68°C overnight or for at least 1.5 hours.
